# CS50p
This repository includes my solutions and projects from CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P). I completed all tasks, learning functions, loops, conditionals, data structures, and file handling. Projects like my encryptor–decryptor showcase my progress, problem-solving skills and the Python knowledge I gained throughout the course.
